        Learning and improving for me has always been a priority, therefore I am
        constantly looking for new opportunities to grow and progress in my
        field through college classes and external certificates. In my various
        internships I dealt with event organization and promotion, graphic
        design, digital marketing, sales, social media marketing, accounting and
        global marketing. Besides, I have a predisposition for languages (at the
        moment I am fluent in English, Italian, Spanish and French), which makes
        it easier for me to interact with a culturally diverse market.
